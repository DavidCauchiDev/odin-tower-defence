# Odin Tower Defence (Prototype)

**Odin Tower Defence** is a prototype project built using the [Odin programming language](https://odin-lang.org/) and [Sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol), a minimal set of cross-platform libraries. This project is intended primarily as a **learning tool** to explore low-level game development techniques and systems programming concepts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

This project was created to:

- Learn and experiment with the **Odin language**.
- Understand how to use **Sokol** for graphics, input, and timing.
- Practice building core game systems from scratch.
- Gain experience in **low-level game architecture** without relying on full-featured game engines.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Language:** Odin
- **Rendering & Input:** Sokol (`sokol_app`, `sokol_gfx`, `sokol_time`)
- **Platform:** Cross-platform (dependent on Odin and Sokol compatibility)
